            <li>"I don't want to be alone, I want to be left alone." - Audrey Hepburn</li>
            <li>"I think it's good for a person to spend time alone. It gives them an opportunity to discover who they are and to figure out why they are always alone." - Amy Sedaris</li>
            <li>"I was drawn to all the wrong things: I liked to drink, I was lazy, I didn't have a god, politics, ideas, ideals. I was settled into nothingness; a kind of non-being, and I accepted it. I didn't make for an interesting person. I didn't want to be interesting, it was too hard. What I really wanted was only a soft, hazy space to live in, and to be left alone." - Charles Bukowski</li>
            <li>"I think that one of the reasons why people look towards the end of humanity is that people are afraid to be alone. They have a fear of not existing. They have a fear of not mattering. And they see reflected in the world a sort of way of not mattering." - T. S. Eliot</li>
            <li>"The eternal quest of human beings is to shatter his loneliness." - Norman Cousins</li>
            <li>"I used to think that the worst thing in life was to end up alone. It's not. The worst thing in life is to end up with people who make you feel alone." - Robin Williams</li>
            <li>"I don't want to be alone. I want to be left alone." - Greta Garbo</li>
            <li>"The eternal quest of the individual human being is to shatter his loneliness." - Norman Cousins</li>
